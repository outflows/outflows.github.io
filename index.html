            <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://www.brera.inaf.it/" target="_blank">INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera</a>, working with Dr. Lara Nava. My main interests are related to high-energy astrophysics. Before moving to INAF, I worked with <a href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/directory/davide-lazzati" target="_blank">Prof. Davide Lazzati</a> at Oregon State University. I obtained my PhD in Astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I worked under supervision of <a href="https://rodrigonemmen.com">Prof. Rodrigo Nemmen</a>.</p>
            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>My main scientific interests are related to understanding the electromagnetic signatures associated with different events involving black holes, neutron stars, and active galactic nuclei. To accomplish this, the main tools I use are large-scale computer simulations, semi-analytical calculations and telescope data, especially Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations.</p>

            <p>Currently, my research is centered on gamma-ray bursts, which are the most energetic explosions in the universe, and how the environment in which these explosions occur affects their electromagnetic signatures. I hope that, when viewed in the wider context of multimessenger observations, these findings will help us obtain a full picture of what happens when compact objects merge.</p>

            <p>In my free time I read and listen to a lot of music, or maybe you can find me outdoors.</p>
