            <p>I am a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the <a href="http://www.iag.usp.br/" target="_blank">Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences</a> of the <a href="http://www5.usp.br/" target="_blank">University of SÃ£o Paulo</a>. My advisor is <a href="https://rodrigonemmen.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Rodrigo Nemmen</a>, and I study accretion flows onto black holes and their relation with relativistic jets. To achieve this, I mostly use large-scale computer simulations, but I have also used data from the Fermi Space Telescope.<!--and I study how the formation of relativistic jets is related to accretion flows onto black holes. To achieve this, I mostly use large-scale computer simulations.--></p>

            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>My main scientific interests are related to astrophysical black holes. In particular, I am working to improve our understanding of the relation between accretion flows - matter that is being pulled towards black holes, and relativistic jets - matter that gets pushed away from the black hole at very high speeds. My goals are to understand the underlying physics behind such extreme environments, and to connect these principles to the observations of different phenomena in a variety of scenarios involving active galactic nuclei and stellar-mass black holes.<!--Directly related to this are the electromagnetic spectra of the radiation emitted during these processes. Understanding them gives us many hints about what is happening at such extreme environments.--> Check my <a href="research.html">research</a> for more details.</p>

			<p>I am also engaged in <a href="outreach.html">outreach</a> activities, since I believe in the importance of promoting awareness and communicating science findings with the general public.</p>

            <p>In my free time I play rugby, read, collect beer glasses and beer bottle caps.</p>
